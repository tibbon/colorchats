# ColorChats

This was based on Heroku's WebSocket Chat Demo (https://github.com/heroku-examples/ruby-websockets-chat-demo).

Built with [faye-websocket](https://github.com/faye/faye-websocket-ruby), [Puma](https://github.com/puma/puma), and [Sinatra](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra).

Make sure to run `heroku labs:enable websockets` in your terminal to enable websockets.

Check out the [live demo](http://colorchats.herokuapp.com/). Sometimes it is getting H23 errors (which cause 503's) on Heroku. Unsure why.
